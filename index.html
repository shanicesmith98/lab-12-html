    <h2>What is a Poem?</h2>
    <p>A poem is a collection of spoken or written words that expresses ideas or emotions in a powerfully vivid and imaginative style. A poem is comprised of a particular rhythmic and metrical pattern. In fact, it is a literary technique that is different from prose or ordinary speech, as it is either in metrical pattern or in free verse. Writers or poets express their emotions through this medium more easily, as they face difficulty when expressing through some other medium. It serves the purpose of a light to take the readers towards the right path. Also, sometimes it teaches them a moral lesson through sugar-coated language. Listed below are some examples of poems.</p>

    <h2>Goat - Haiku</h2>
    <p><em>
      Thundery foreshore
      <br>How a nanny, strange goat prowls
      <br>watching the chocolate
    </em></p>

    <h2>Friend - Haiku</h2>
    <p><em>
      Magical hillside
      <br>An only, springy friend trots
      <br>enjoying the view
    </em></p>

    <h2>Otter - Acrostic</h2>
    <p><em>
      <strong>O</strong>ld lurks wallow
      <br><strong>T</strong>emporary excitements exult
      <br><strong>T</strong>rue hysterics ramble
      <br><strong>E</strong>mbroidered daisies relive
      <br><strong>R</strong>ich flowers ooze
    </em></p>

    <h2>Ode to the Leaf - Sonnet</h2>
    <p><em>
      My acid leaf, you inspire me to write.
      <br>How I hate the way you call, roar and feed,
      <br>Invading my mind day and through the night,
      <br>Always dreaming about the fireweed.<br>
      <br>Let me compare you to a bold clover?
      <br>You are more mighty, yellow and clever.
      <br>Cold storms whip the twiglets of October,
      <br>And autumntime has the compound lever.<br>
      <br>How do I hate you? Let me count the ways.
      <br>I hate your old eyelashes, hands and lip.
      <br>Thinking of your placid hands fills my days.
      <br>My hate for you is the excited strip.<br>
      <br>Now I must away with a blighted heart,
      <br>Remember my sheer words whilst we're apart.<br>
      <br>An only, springy friend trots
      <br>enjoying the view
    </em></p>
